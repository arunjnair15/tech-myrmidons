       "description":"The Singa Project was initiated by the DB System Group at the National University of Singapore in 2014, with a primary focus on distributed deep learning by partitioning the model and data onto nodes in a cluster and parallelising the training. Apache Singa provides a simple programming model and works across a cluster of machines. It is primarily used in natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition. A Singa prototype accepted by Apache Incubator in March 2015 provides a flexible architecture of scalable distributed training and is extendable to run over a wide range of hardware.",

It is Google Brainâ€™s second generation machine learning system and can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs. TensorFlow is deployed in various products of Google like speech recognition, Gmail, Google Photos and even Search.TensorFlow performs numerical computations using data flow graphs. These elaborate the mathematical computations with a directed graph of nodes and edges. Nodes implement mathematical operations and can also represent endpoints to feed in data, push out results or read/write persistent variables. Edges describe the input/output relationships between nodes. Data edges carry dynamically-sized multi-dimensional data arrays or tensors.",

It has many visualisation tools and wizards for creating high-end sophisticated and intelligent machine learning models without any need to learn complex ML algorithms and technologies. Via AML, predictions for applications can be obtained using simple APIs without using custom prediction generation code or complex infrastructure. AML is based on simple, scalable, dynamic and flexible ML technology used by Amazons Internal Scientists community professionals to create Amazon Cloud Services. AML connects to data stored in Amazon S3, Redshift or RDS, and can run binary classification, multi-class categorisation or regression on this data to create models.The key contents used in Amazon ML are listed below.",
